# Expenses Project using React
Deploy at: https://frxxcko.github.io/expenses-project-react

<i>Note: this is not a finished website. 30/06/2022</i>

This project is still under development, I'm triying to build a full <strong>React Expenses App</strong> that implements all the fundamentals of React and more.

Some of the topics you might see in this project as for today:
- Functional Components
- State Handling
- Two Way Binding
- Dinamyc Rendering implementing <strong>map()</strong> method
- UX and Conditional rendering
- Little bit of simple Styling, later I'll implement <strong>Material UI</strong> and/or <strong>Styled Components</strong> 

# Goals to be acomplished in the next iteration
- Add a chart that shows all expenses by month
- Personalized experience and fully operational expenses app
