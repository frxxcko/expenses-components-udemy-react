## Dev comments

In this project I wanted to apply React JS fundamentals, this is a simple project that add expenses to a list and arrange them by date.

This is the begin of my journey as I create more and more little projects to later build a bigger Frontend application with React JS. 
But it's a long journey so grab a cup of your favourite beverage and reach out whenever you feel like!
